DOCUMENTATION
======
*Harass* has a few naming conventions that all team members were required to follow. These being to separate what objects are what and prevent the engine, and programmer, from  becoming confused about what is being implemented. Game Maker 2.0 also enforces unique names across all folders. So, if a sprite is named "Player" there cannot be an object named "Player." The simple guide goes as follows:

* Obj_ => Denotes an Object type.
* Spr_ => Denotes a Sprite object.
* Scr_ => Denotes a Script object.
* Pth_ => Denotes a Path object.
* Rm_  => Denotes a Room object.
* Set_ => Denotes a Tile Set.
* Msc_ => Denotes a Music file to be played as music, not as sound effects.
* Sfx_ => Denotes a Sound Effects file to be played as a sound effect, not music.
* Fts_ => Denotes a Font file.
